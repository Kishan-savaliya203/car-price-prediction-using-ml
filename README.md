üöó Car Price Prediction Project üìà


Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project repository! In this project, I aim to predict car prices using various machine learning algorithms and techniques. I have gone through a rigorous process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to arrive at my best-performing model.


Project Overview üåü



In this project, I've accomplished the following steps:



Data Cleaning: I started by cleaning and preparing the dataset to remove any inconsistencies and missing values.



EDA: Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted, including univariate, bivariate, statistical testing, and multivariate analysis to gain insights into the data.



Feature Engineering: I employed feature engineering techniques to create new features and enhance the predictive power of my models.



Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features was carried out to prepare the data for modeling.



Model Development: I developed two regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.



Model Evaluation: Thorough model evaluation was performed, and various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared were used to compare and select the best-performing model.
